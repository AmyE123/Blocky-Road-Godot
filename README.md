# Blocky Road Godot

Learning about Godot and the GDScript Language through remaking Blocky Road in it.

*Blocky Road is <a href="https://github.com/AmyE123/Blocky-Road">another game of mine originally made in Unity</a>.*

## Built With
* [Godot V3.4.4](https://godotengine.org/download) - The game engine used
* [GDScript](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/gdscript/gdscript_basics.html) - The programming language used

## Coding Conventions
I'm using the [GDScript Style Guide](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/gdscript/gdscript_styleguide.html) with my code.
